# TechNova Hackathon TeamAlertRepo
 This repository contains necessary files and data related to UW TechNova Hackathon.
 
 Our team utilzed HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap for the website. We used Figma for design prototypes and creation. 
 The main purpuse of the "A!ert" website is to provide users with information related to natural and man made issues/disasters such as floods, landslides, Tsunami's etc. 
 
 Instead of having to open a bunch of convoluting and misinforming websites, users can utilize A!ert to gather information about what they must be aware of. We use geotagging and location services to track a user and display data that is update.
